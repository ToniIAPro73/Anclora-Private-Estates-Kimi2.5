# Core Changelog

## 2026-02-26
- Added feature scaffold `menu-overlay-clarity-redesign` (ANCLORA-MENU-002) with rules, skill, prompts, spec/test/gate artifacts.
- Completed redesign of navigation overlay toward a cleaner premium hierarchy and full i18n coverage.
- Added automated feature tests for menu structure and i18n keys (`tests/menu-overlay-redesign.test.js`).
- Gate final `MENU_002`: OK (conditional, lint debt remains outside feature scope).
